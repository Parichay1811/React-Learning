BASICS:

In react the data always flows from the parent to child.
If we want to send a function to the child that is made in the parent then we have something called as props in react.

Example:
Suppose we have a project where the flow is, App --> Container --> Cards

if I need a data to show in the card first it will go to the App then to the Container then to the Cards.


Key points:

1. Everything big is components
2. components can have data and it can be stored using the useState.
3. Data is called as State.
4. To change anything in the component just change state and the component will get changed automatically.
5. props are used to sending data from parent to child component.
6. Effects run when the DOM is loaded.
7. JSX is similler to HTML. to write js inside the jsx we use { }  breaces.


Hooks:

Hooks are nothing but the special function which allows us to use the react features. which also a feature that makes functional component to work like a class component.
we use the 'use' keyWord to write any hooks. Example: useState, useEffect, useReducer and so many...

useState:
useState hook is a function to add state to a functional component.

useEffect:
useEffect is used to perform side effects like data fetching, subscriptions, or DOM manipulations etc.
